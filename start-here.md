# What's My Writing Corner?
My Writing Corner is specifically designed to be the place where you go if you're looking to start a blog or if you're trying to understand how to take it from a simple hobby into an actually substantial income source. 

If that is you, then you've come to the right place, let me show you around!


## What is a Blog after all?
If you're here, you probably have a good idea of what a blog is, after all, you're trying to start one. That being said, I think it's important to understand my take on it, so you understand what the direction of this site is.

To me, _a blog is whatever you want it to be_.
I know how that sounds, but trust me, you don't have to be on WordPress to have a blog, and you don't have to stick to one topic (or as the "pros" call it: _Niching down_) to have a blog. As long as you share your content with others, then you're blogging!  And don't let anyone else tell you otherwise!

Sometimes people confuses the actual definition of a blog with the steps that normally work if you want to _grow_ a blog. There is a difference and sadly, for the latter there _are_ steps that normally are effective and recommended. By all means, if you want to break the mold and try to succeed by doing other things, you're more than welcomed, again, what others are usually suggesting are best practices and proven techniques, not necessarily mandatory.

## What kind of content can you expect from this place?
Like I mentioned, the point of My Writing Corner is to provide you with all the information you need to succeed, and that comes in many forms:

- You'll find straight-to-the-point tutorials, such as [_WPForms: A Beautiful Typeform Alternative for WordPress_](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/wpforms-a-typeform-alternative-wordpress), 
- Resources reviews, such as [Best blogging tools for 2019](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/best-blogging-tools) and [Pick the Best Web Hosting for your Blogs](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/web-hosting-for-blogs)
- Tips & Tricks for bloggers, like [5 Guaranteed Ways For Getting New Blog Post Ideas](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/getting-blogpost-ideas)
- And some lighter, more opinion-based articles such as [Should I start a blog?](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/should-i-start-a-blog) or [6 things Stranger Things can teach you about blogging](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/stranger-things-lessons)

## What now?
Well, if you're just starting, I think the best move for you is to sign up for my [FREE 5 Steps Program for Launching your blog](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/5-step-program). 

With it, you'll receive a weekly email with information, tips and tricks and a great checklist you can print and use on your own to make sure you're really doing everything the experts are recommending to get your blog _to the next level_. 

_See you around!_
