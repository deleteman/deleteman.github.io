</div>

Welcome to my brand new __FREE__ beginner's program. It is a 5 step program where you'll learn everything you need to get your blog up and running, and once you have it, how to keep working it to get the most out of it.

<span data-sumome-listbuilder-embed-id="083724f821f3e1959ddca168416189fa4bfea72ef0506bf5537231d11f9c0579"></span>

Once you've signed-up to the program, you'll start getting emails at once. No worries, __I will not spam you__, after today's email, you'll only get one more every week, with the next step of the program. 
So basically, you have one week to work on the lessons and tips each week, that should be enough time for you to get some idea of how you'll be using these tips & tricks for your own blog. And the best part? You can _email me_ any questions and comments you might have!

These emails will come from my _personal_ email address, so if you need to, you can contact me directly. Got questions about the lesson? Hit reply, Got a complaint about my comments? Hit reply. Want to share your experience... you know the drill.

The content for the program is the following:

1. **Step 1**: The checklist. Week 1 will contain a detailed checklist for everything you need to start _thinking_ about your brand new blog and the kind of thing you need to consider once you've made up your mind on creating it.
2. **Step 2**: The tools. Second week will cover basic blogging tools. No blogger is capable to doing everything themselves, but the right tools can help you move a very long way before having to start looking for outside help.
3. **Step 3**: Reaching others. Learn how to get your blog in front of the eyes of your readers. What kind of platforms and techniques to use to achieve that goal.
4. **Step 4**: Other pages. Besides your articles, what other information do you have on your blog? That's right, you probably haven't given that too much thought, have you? This lesson will cover the basic pages to have on your brand new blog and why.
5. **Step 5**: First posts. Once everything is setup and running. What will you write? Getting the writing engine started can take some practice, so I'll go over the first 4 blog posts you should write for a brand new blog.

That is it, and again, you have __one week between steps__, so you'll have enough time to play and test things around.
