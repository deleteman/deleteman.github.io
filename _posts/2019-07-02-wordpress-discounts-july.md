</div>

During the month of July, our friends in the United States are celebrating Independence Day, and because of that, many companies take the opportunity to offer special discount codes. 
Here are my top 3 picks for discount codes with a few honorable mentions because I really think their prices are amazing, even if they're not specifically because of July 4th.


## Hosting with FlyWheel

    <a href="https://share.getf.ly/d11v3j" target="_blank" ><img src="/assets/images/flywheel_logo_vert_blue.png" alt="FlyWheel" /></a>
</div>
During the dates of __July 8 at 12:00 am CT__ to __July 15 at 11:59 pm CT__ the promo code **flyjuly19** will be granting you the whooping offer of:

_3 months free on the first year of new annual Flywheel subscriptions **AND 25% off add-ons** (White Label, performance insights, and/or plugin updates)_

Note that this offer will only appear on their [pricing page](https://getflywheel.com/pricing/) between the dates mentioned above.

So make sure you [check them out](https://share.getf.ly/d11v3j) if you're looking to host in the next few days!

## Get your favorite theme for just USD 19 at MyThemeShop
That's right, the folks at [MyThemeShop](https://mythemeshop.com/) are offering a special 4th of July discount ending on July 7th.
By visiting their site, you're automatically participaging, **no code required** and during this period, you'll be able to grab _any theme or pluging_ for just USD 19 (considering there are some very expensive themes out there, this is an **amazing deal**)

Check it out at [MyThemeShop.com](https://mythemeshop.com/)!

## Get themes, logos, UI kits, fonts AND hosting from TemplateMonster for only USD 39

</div>
This one is probably **the best** offer so far, which is why I left it for last.

The good folks from [TemplateMonster](https://www.templatemonster.com/?aff=mywritingcorner) are having an _Independence Day_ steal (yeah, I was going to call it a SALE, but this is just too much). 

<p style="clear:both"></p>

Here is what they're offering:

- 3 WordPress Themes
- 3 HTML Themes
- Logos and icons in CSS, SVG, PNG, JPG, PSD and other formats
- A corporate identity template consisting on a set of pre-designed logos, standard letterhead, envelope and business cards layouts (what?!)
- UI kits
- Animated banners available in 7 different sizes
- Multipurpose social media pack for Instagram 
- Illustrations
- Fonts
- Landing Page templates
- PowerPoint templates
- And 1 year free of hosting

All of that for only USD 39! The entire bundle is estimated to cost around USD 1400 so if this is not the definition of a steal, *I don't know what is*.
And on top of that, they're offering extra add-ons for **up to 40% off** , such as On Page SEO Optimization, Web Copywriting and others. You should definitely [check them out!](https://www.templatemonster.com/?aff=mywritingcorner)
