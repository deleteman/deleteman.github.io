# Web Hosting for Blogs: How to pick the best hosting for your blog in 2019?

One of the steps of setting up your own blog is finding the best Web Hosting company you can. Sometimes blog and hosting come as part of the same bundled package, usually limiting your options for picking blogging platform (i.e usually WordPress comes ‚Äúnative‚Äù on almost every modern web hosting offering, but what if you‚Äôre not planning on using WP?).

In this article, I want to cover what kind of offering you‚Äôll need from a Web Hosting company and how each piece of it will affect (or benefit) your blogging (and your reader‚Äôs) experience.


## But first, what IS Web Hosting anyway?

Just a quick check, in case you‚Äôre not really into tech at all (which is not required for starting a blog, so don‚Äôt feel bad!).
Web Hosting is simply put, the place where your content will reside. Anything and everything on Internet needs to reside *somewhere* , no matter where, it‚Äôll be a server (a very optimized computer) that‚Äôll have it on its hard drive. You don‚Äôt need to worry about that part, all you need to know, is that there is someone there, making sure your content is available, and if something goes wrong, they can bring up a back-up and make like nothing happened.

That‚Äôs all you need to understand about this concept: a place for your content to live in. If you got it, you can move on (if you haven‚Äôt feel free to [reach out](http://www.mywritingcorner.net/contact) or leave a comment down below!).

## What are the relevant parts from a Hosting offer?

Web Hosting companies tend to offer quite a lot of things on their pages. In fact, some of them don‚Äôt only offer hosting, but in fact, they normally allow you to just get a Domain Name, or Hosting & Domain, some of them give you a lot of control over your hosting activities, while others make sure to do everything for you.

What I‚Äôm trying to say is: even when I can standardize the information displayed of all their options, you‚Äôll need to have a clear idea of what you‚Äôre aiming to do in order to pick up the one that suites your needs the best. Trust me, there is no *silver bullet* here, you decide based on your personal needs.

Now, these are my top points from the offer I tend to compare when checking out hosting plans:

### 1. Is it Shared Hosting or VPS?
This one is critical because it could potentially damage the performance of your blog without you doing anything. You see, a Shared Hosting, like the name suggests, is one where the provider shares the physical resources of the servers among many customers. 
That is, a server could potentially have 200 TB of disk space, 20 Gb of RAM and still be a problem to your tiny blog, if there are other customers constantly consuming those resources.
It is true, however that providers tend to cap resource utilization per account, in order to avoid someone hogging all server resources and directly crashing everything else living in the same physical computer.  But then again, that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you‚Äôre literally sharing the living space for your blog.

Now, on the other side, VPS (or Virtual Private Servers) are meant to ensure a higher level of resource availability for your website. So you need to understand what kind of traffic you‚Äôll be having from your readers in order to determine  if you need a shared hosting or a VPS solution.
Do note, however than VPS options tend to give you a lot more freedom, but you‚Äôll need to understand what to do with it (how to install what you need, and how to set it up, there is a lot more freedom, but it comes at a price üôÇ ).

As for prices, Shared Hosting tends to be cheaper (for obvious reasons), while VPS will cost you more, so make sure you‚Äôre paying exactly what you‚Äôre looking for


### 2. Does it come with a free Domain Name?
At least one, and ideally not for just a year, but usually that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll get. Remember to read the fine letter, ‚Äúfree‚Äù domains, usually are actually free for the first year, tops, then you‚Äôll be in charge of paying for them, so make sure you understand the price before setting it up.

### 3. Is my bandwidth limited?
Limited bandwidth is something some providers do for the cheaper tiers of their offering. You‚Äôll want to aim for those who list an ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù as part of the offer. Limiting your bandwith makes little to no sense, and getting a bandwidth-limited plan is not ideal if you‚Äôre planning on going viral with your content now, is it?

### 4. Do they offer free SSL?
SSL (or Secure Socket Layer for the uninitiated) is an extra level of security between you and your reader. If we want to get technical, it means the channel (or connection) between your reader‚Äôs computer and your server‚Äôs computer is encrypted, so no-one can capture the data while it travels and change it (or do anything with it) on its way.  Have you noticed how some URLs start with HTTP and others with HTTP**S** ? Well, that‚Äôs where the S comes from (it actually comes from Secure, but you get my point). 
These are especially useful if you have  a WordPress blog or similar, if you have comments through username, or anything that is dynamic on your blog. In fact, even if you don‚Äôt, having an SSL certificate it‚Äôs a nice extra insurance since browsers such as Google Chrome will add a little green padlock next to your URL ensuring your reader that everything is safe.
So, do you want an SSL certificate? Yes, yo do.


## Let the picking begging 

There are too many Web Hosting providers out there, making a list and comparing them all makes no sense, so I‚Äôll deal with the most common ones, and tell you what I found. Sounds good?
Also, remember that this is just a set of guidelines based on my own personal experience. You‚Äôll need to visit these pages and review their full offers if you want to before deciding.
Here is the basic information you need to know about them:


| **Provider**                                                                               | **Shared vs VPS?** | **Free Domain Name**                       | **Limited Bandwidth** | **Free SSL**                                     | **Price Range / month (Shared hosting)** | **Price Range / month**<br>**(VPS)**                                  |

| [GoDaddy](http://GoDaddy.com)                                                              | Both               | Yes (only if you buy yearly hosting plans) | Unlimited             | Only for a year and not available on basic plans | USD 7.99  - USD 24.99                    | USD 29.99 - USD 139.99                                                |
| [HostGator](http://HostGator.com)                                                          | Both               | No                                         | Unlimited             | Yes                                              | USD 6.95 - USD 14.95                     | USD 89.95 - USD 159.95                                                |
| [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=cdba41f973306155d408cb18cf0d6848) | Both               | Yes                                        | Unlimited             | Yes                                              | USD 11.95 - USD 34.95                    | USD 80 - USD 240                                                      |
| [NameCheap](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&u=2099099&m=46483&urllink=&afftrack=)   | Both               | Yes but only for .website domains          | Unlimited             | Yes                                              | USD 5.76 - USD 17.76                     | USD 14.88 - USD 24.88 <br>(with added prices based on extra services) |



----------

As you can see, most of them provide the same basic services inside the same relative price range. Do note however that **all of them have different offers and sales actives at all times**, I‚Äôve listed full prices for all of them, but if you go visit their pricing pages, you‚Äôll probably notice how some of those numbers are cheaper for the either the first few months or the entire first year.

----------

**And the winner is‚Ä¶**

But, if we had to pick one, which one would we pick? From the list above, the cheapest and most versatile of them all would be [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/deleteman/).

## WordPress hosting

What if, instead of going with a custom blogging platform, you *actually* do want to just go with WP? That‚Äôs great! This is one of the most common perks out there, and they all have it!
Prices aren‚Äôt all equal of course:


| **Provider**                                                                               | **Price Range / month** | **Monthly Visits range** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/deleteman/)                                                            | USD 7.99 - USD 14.99    | 10k - 100k               |
| [GoDaddy](http://GoDaddy.com)                                                              | USD 9.99 - USD 29.99    | 25k - 800k               |
| [HostGator](http://HostGator.com)                                                          | USD 9.95 - USD 74.95    | 100k - 500k              |
| [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=cdba41f973306155d408cb18cf0d6848) | USD 11.95 - USD 34.95   | 10k - 100k               |
| [NameCheap](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&u=2099099&m=46483&urllink=&afftrack=)   | USD 3.88 - USD 11.88    | 50k - 500k               |


----------

All providers offer the same set of benefits as above for WordPress hosting (i.e. free SSL, free domain, etc)

----------

**And the winner is‚Ä¶**

Again, all of them share a similar price range, and all of them share a similar expected monthly visits for their price ranges. But I had to pick one, I would go with: [NameCheap](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&u=2099099&m=46483&urllink=&afftrack=)
They provide the cheapest entry level price for a very decent  expected monthly visits (50k!). If you‚Äôre just starting out, this one is particularly great!
<a target="_blank" href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1188772&amp;u=2099099&amp;m=46483&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack="><img src="https://static.shareasale.com/image/46483/promopage_004_728x90.gif" border="0" alt="Big Discounts for Domains, Hosting, SSL and more" /></a>

That being said, the **especial mention** needs to go to  [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/deleteman/), because of their USD 200 of free marketing on Google Ads, Bing and other social networks.


## Closing thoughts

No-one can tell you which web hosting provider to choose without knowing your actual needs and expectations. I hope that with this article, I was able to show you the basics for choosing for yourself that service. After all, it is quite important!
Please share your thoughts on the comments section about which provider you‚Äôre using right now and why. If you have other options, that will also help readers get a different perspective.

*See you on the next one!*
