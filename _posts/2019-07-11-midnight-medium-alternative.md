As I’ve [mentioned before](http://www.mywritingcorner.net/2019/06/25/top-6-blogging-platforms.html), Medium is one of the many possible blogging platforms to choose from. If you don’t care about customization and only want to get your word out, with minimum monetization capabilities, then Medium is definitely your platform of choice.

Now, let me ask you my favorite question: *what if …? What if you actually care about control over your blog?* 
Then maybe, what you want is something else. And that’s where [Midnight](https://getmidnight.com/) comes into play. 


## Just like Medium but with the right features

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think Medium is useless, not at all, in fact, they created a very nice platform where you can share your content and find readers considerably easy, and all of that for FREE. 
But of course, everything free comes at a price doesn’t it?. In their case, control over your content. 

Midnight tries to give back that control to you, the writer, while at the same time, giving you a very minimal and powerful UI for you to write on. In other words, the writing experience Medium gives their users, but with all the bells and whistles you wish they gave you.
And they’re doing this through [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), an Open Source blogging platform built in Node.js. So you can think of Midnight as a fully managed Ghost blog.

**Fully managed**
Like I said, they manage your servers, they manage traffic, all you need to worry about is writing content and making your blog look exactly the way you want it to look.
Ever had to deal with security updates? A WordPress version update? Which SEO plugin are you using? Are you sure you should be installing that? 
All these questions are removed from your mind with managed  platforms, which for a blog are a great thing. If you were running any other type application, something custom or with other features other than blogging, then I would probably advice against it. But for a blog, something that has a very limited and well defined set of features, this is **perfect.**

**Powerful editing features**
With Medium, we’re used to being able to do some basic styling of the text (no color picking, or actual size selection though), adding images, code snippets and some maybe a video. That’s it. How many times did you wish you could add more? Do more with your content? 
Thanks to the powerful editor on Ghost, you get that and a lot more!

Thanks to Ghost’s dynamic cards, you can include practically anything on your articles, want to add a video? Done! How about adding custom HTML? Done!


**Themeable**
That is something else  Medium can’t give you, the look & feel of your blog is moving nowhere. Don’t get me wrong, their styling looks very neat and clean, but that doesn’t mean it fits every blog and you might want to customize yours. 
And Midnight can provide that, in fact, they can allow you to add custom navigation bars, tracking code and more with just a few clicks on their UI.

**Full control over your content**
Where with Medium you’re constrained in regards  to what you can do with your blog other than writing, Midnight gives you full control.
Yeap, again, there is a common theme repeating, isn’t there? Full control, full customization, you get the point. Your content is yours, the pages you add to your blog are yours and under your control. Want to add an “About me” page? Done, a “Contact me” page? Go ahead!
Need to monetize your blog? Fantastic! Pick your poison, affiliate links? Ads? That is all in the cards, just make it your own. 

**Only one price tag**
Finally, another interesting fact about Midnight is that they only have 1 price tag. That’s right, all you’re paying is 15 dollars a month, and for that you get:


- All Ghost Blog Features
- Automatic SSL Certificate
- Custom Domain Setup
- Managed Installation
- Managed Hosting & Security
- Automatic Updates
- Server Maintainence & Backups
- Priority Email & Chat Support
- 30 Day Money Back Guarantee
- Cancel Anytime
    

The highlights from that list are:

- Custom Domain Setup: They don’t give it to you for FREE, but you can buy a cheap one on [NameCheap](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&u=2099099&m=46483&urllink=&afftrack=) and configure it for your blog. So instead of going *your-domain.midnight.com* you can have your own custom domain working.
- SSL certificate included. This is a big plus, since you’re letting your readers know yours is a safe place to leave their contact information on.
- Cancel anytime. You’re not forced to keep paying if you’re not happy with their service.

The only donwside to their business plan I see, and this is from a user perspective alone, is that they don’t really have a FREE trial, or mention anything about a FREE test period. If you want to test Midnight, you’ll have to pay the 15 bucks first. Given the amount of free options and free-to-try services for bloggers out there, it seems like they’re missing an opportunity right there.

But that is it for my Midnight review, what do you think? Are you willing to give them a try and migrate from Medium into this new platform? Leave a comment if you’ve try them and let others know what you think!

*See you on the next one!*
