</div>
We've all been there, brand new blog and no content inside it. If this is your first time though, it's perfectly normal that you might be wondering: _what now?_
Your first instinct is probably to start writing up some blog posts, but what should be your first one? Have you actually planned anything? I've written about [tips and tricks you can use to come up with blog post topics](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/getting-blogpost-ideas), but that comes after this.

In this article, I want to answer the question: what to write about on a blog? And I want to do it by recommending you the **first 5 pages you should create**. 
Notice how I said _pages_ and not _articles_ , there are other pages you need to have on your blog to help readers understand who you are and what they can expect from you. And trust me, I understand that your first reaction to this would be to put a pin on these pages and focus on the articles, after all, what's Google going to index? Your bio? There are, however, very good reasons to focus first on these pages and then on writing your content, bare with me for a minute or two, would you?

So, without further ado, let me tell you what are the first 5 pages you should be worrying about:

## 1. The About me page
If you're looking for your reader to connect with you, then this is one of the main pages you should be working on. Forget about your blog posts for the time being and sit down to share your story.
[This page](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/about) is meant to tell your story to your reader, it'll be the first thing they look for once they read your articles, why? Because in it they'll be looking for reasons to believe and trust whatever message you're trying to spread with your blog. 

Are you trying to make a name for yourself in your niche? Write about your experience in that field. Is there a personal story you can think of that's related to the subject? Share it if you can, it'll help others understand where you're coming from.
Another important aspect of yourself to share here is your picture. This might sound a bit scary for us introverts, but remember, you're trying to prove that you're someone worth reading and if you can't even prove you're a real person, who's to say your readers will implicitly trust your writing? Nobody!

So remember, what can you share in your _About me_ page?

+ Your picture
+ The reason why you've created the blog
+ Some background related to your blog's niche and how it relates to you
+ Finally, share with your readers the main reason why you think they should read _your_ blog and not any of the other thousands out there.

## 2. Contact page
Your [contact page](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/contact) is yet another page you'll want to have ready sooner rather than later. Why? Because the minute you have something your readers relate to they might want to reach out. 
This page can be constructed in many ways, depending on the platform you're using, the plugins at your disposal or even the amount of technical know-how you might already have.

The point of this page is to let others reach out, that might be in the form of you publishing your personal email, sharing your social media links or even having a contact form ready to be used.

The key aspects for this page are:

+ Letting your know readers why they might want to contact you.
+ Letting them know why they shouldn't (maybe you're no longer accepting guest posts or collaborations, it's important to let them know that too)
+ Have a simple way for them to reach you, possibly several ways (i.e email, social media, contact form and so on)
+ Make it clear and easy to understand. This page doesn't have to have a 3000-word essay inside, once your readers get here, there is only one thing they're looking to do, make sure it's easy for them to do it.

## 3. Cover your legal backside
If you're writing activities cover anything other than writing about your day with no intention of profit, then you should think about writing a few legal pages. To be more specific: 

+ The privacy policy page, where you disclose the information you're saving from your users. Be it email addresses, names or even simply basic traffic tracking information (this includes using Google Analytics), you need to let your readers know you're keeping it and how you're using it.
+ Your disclosure page, where you let your readers know all the different ways you're monetizing your blog. It is important and a must-have especially if you're looking into monetization.

For more details, check out this article I wrote as a guest post for Golden Bloggerz about [the pages you need to create and where to get that content if you're hoping to blog legally](https://www.goldenbloggerz.com/blogging-legally/). 

## 4. The _Start Here_ page
If you pay attention, you'll see how almost every pro blogger has a link called [Start Here](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/start-here) on their main menu. And if you've been checking them out, you'll find yourself clicking that link quite often, because the hope is that you'll get all the information you need to understand who that person is and what kind of information you'll be getting out of their blog.

That's exactly what you should focus on for your very own "Start Here" page. Unlike your "About me" page, where you only talk about yourself, this page should cover the basics of that, but also add some links for your most relevant posts on your niche (check out the next page for that), and if you have, definitely list and add ways for readers to sign-up for your mailing list.

Think about what you're expecting to find on all those Start Here links you clicked before, and translate that into your blog and your content.

## 5. Your first article: the definition post
You do want to write blog posts for your blog after all, don't you? We'll end this list of pages with your very first article. 

The definition post is meant to present your view about your niche. Take my case for instance: my first post is a list of reasons [why starting a blog is a great idea](https://www.mywritingcorner.net/should-i-start-a-blog). In your case, take a good look at whatever topic you're writing about and try to sit down and define it in your own way. Try to focus on answering questions such as:
+ What is it?
+ How does it work?
+ Who's the target audience for it?
+ And why is it so important?

These are the questions people just starting to get into the niche will have, and answering them will get them straight into your blog, so focus on those for this page. 


## Closing thoughts
Those are the first 5 pages you need to have on your blog before you start thinking about writing blog posts. And even if you've already started writing without having these pages set up, take some time to create them, it'll help your readers connect with you, understand who you are and (most importantly), why they can trust what you have to say.
Finally, setting up these pages will also help them understand where to find your best content, so don't forget to add them!

Now let me ask _you_ this: do you have any other pages that you've added to your blog because it helps readers get a better experience? What was it? Let me know down in the comments, I'd love to know!
