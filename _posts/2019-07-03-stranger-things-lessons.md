# 6 things Stranger Things teach you about blogging?

I know right? Yes, maybe I’m trying to jump on the hype wagon that is Stranger Things, but bare with me, because such as many other works of art can teach you things about your own personal journey, so can this great show teach you (and everyone else) a thing or two about blogging.

Let me elaborate.

Of course, please do note **there are some spoilers for season 1 and 2 of Stranger Things**, so if that’s a problem for you, pick up a Netflix subscription, watch the damn shown and get back to see if I’m right or not.


## 1. Be nerdy, it pays out

What says **nerd** more than the boys showing up at school all dressed up as the Ghost Busters to find out, they’re the only ones wearing customs, at all?

How is that a good thing again? The entire scene wasn’t really cool at the time, was it? But looking at it in more detail, you’ll notice that **the level of detail on those customs is amazing.** That’s no small feat, and if you’re a cosplayer, you probably know what I’m talking about. The proton packs show an amazing level of detail, and that’s where I’m trying to go with this point. Being nerdy isn’t about dressing up or liking sci-fi, it’s about caring about a topic so much that whatever you do in relation to it needs to be perfect.  So if you're writing a blog, make sure you tackle whatever niche you’re writing about with a nerdy mindset.


## 2. Extra skills always help

Everyone on the team has an extra skill, one that at at first glance, doesn’t really seem like much. For instance, Mike is the de-facto D&D Dungeon Master, and eventually ends up being the leading personality within the group, Austin (a.k.a the Compass Master) is amazing with his geographical orientation skills and that eventually pays out in season 2. I mean, even Max, the new girl in the group gets nicknamed as Zoomer because of her awesome skating skills. All these abilities end up working out on their favor during the show and the same thing can happen to you.

Sit back and ask yourself this: “what are you good at?”. It doesn’t matter if the answer is solving puzzles, playing chess or even doing crochet, whatever the answer to your question is, *you just got your main resource for making your blog (and blog posts) unique on your own way.*

Leverage your skills to make your work unique, that’ll help you stand out from other bloggers writing about the same thing.


## 3. Being a bit crazy or weird is not a bad thing

Who would’ve thought the crazy, no haired, bloody nose Eleven from episode 1, season 1 would end up being the super-powered main character of the series?

Well, in-line with the previous lesson, finding your quirks and running with them will help you stand out among the crowd. Yes, maybe you’ll get some polarization  and some will hate you for never come back, but at the same time, those who like you will *love you.* 

That’s the effect being unique has, the audience you create will be loyal to you and will keep coming back because they actually like reading the way you write!


## 4. Confront your fears, don't run away from them 

Who else was yelling “Get the heck out of there for the love of god” when Steve confronted the Demo-dogs using Negan’s club?
I know I was!

He just kept swinging at them like there was no tomorrow and they all got out of there alive, which is still crazy in my eyes! But don’t let me deviate from the point: fight your fears.
And when it comes to blogging (or writing in general), the same question gets asked over and over again: *should I try to publish even if I’m not that good a writer?* or *I’m afraid people won’t like my writing, what do I do?*

My answer to both is the same: don’t overthink it. Go ahead, do the thing that scares you, whether is fighting a demon dog from the Upsidedown realm, or publishing an article on a blog, and see what happens. If you get bad feedback (as long as it’s constructive criticism), incorporate it, learn from it and try to apply it on your next piece. 
If on the other hand, the feedback you get is not constructive (as in “your writing sucks, stop doing it!”), which is probably worst case scenario for you, ignore it. Delete the comment if you can, hide it, or just don’t read it and keep going. Take it as a learning experience and incorporate the following phrase (which is one of my favorite ones btw):

*Every ‘no’ gets me one step closer to a ‘yes’*

I’m not sure who said it honestly, there are many attributions to different people on the Internet, so I’ll let you decide, but either case: make it your own and live by it.


## 5. It takes time to break out and turn into a super powered telekinetic girl

Yeah, that one is kind of specific, but you get the point. Eleven’s journey isn’t quick, she doesn’t really appear as the all powerful girl we see at the end of season 2 when she closes the portal.

And the same can be said about your blog, and your writing career for that matter. Getting people to read your posts takes time, getting people to *want to come back to your blog* takes time, getting Google to rank you #1 on their results page … you guessed it, **it takes time**. So be patient, try to enjoy the journey and try to learn on your way to the top. Hone your skills, practice, practice, practice, at the end you’ll too be able to close The Gate.



## 6. Add emotion to your writing

Finally, take a second look at the show, if you’re an 80’s kid, then probably while watching it you’re filled with nostalgia, aren’t you? All those 80’s references thrown at your face, the show runners are using the same kind of tactics others such as Ernest Cline use for Ready Player One (great book BTW!), they plan with your sense of nostalgia. They try to get you back to a place where you were happy and safe.

You need to try and do the same thing with your writing. No, I’m not talking about adding 80’s references in your posts, I mean trying to appeal to the emotional side of your reader. Try to reach them on an emotional level, finding out what they like and using it to connect with them. Once you achieve it, that reader is not only coming back, but also sharing your content with others and that’s exactly what you want. The endorsement from that person will be a lot better than your best crafted social media campaign, because it’ll come from a real person sharing their experience with others.


## In conclusion

In conclusion, Stranger Things can teach us a lot of good lessons, just remember to use them to improve your blogging too.
