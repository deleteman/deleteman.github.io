# 100k Views Each Month On Technical Stories? My One Secret on Medium.

I publish between 3 to 5 technical articles every month, and I’m getting around 80k to 100k views out of them, and here I’m going to reveal to you my number one tip, my über-secret sauce, my incredibly useful technique. Essentially after you read this story, I’ll have to *neuralize you* to keep my secret from going viral, but I’m such a nice guy that I’ll do it anyway…

Now in a more serious note: there are tons of articles out there giving advice on how to write great stories so everyone would read them. They tell you to forget about social media, marketing, and literally everything else and just write quality content.

And they’re probably right! But sometimes they can focus too much on giving generic advice and they leave out one particular type of blogger who has a very particular type of audience: you… or… you know, the technical blogger.

## What Makes Tech Bloggers Different?

We’re definitely different from other bloggers in the sense that we’re not just competing with other bloggers to have our articles being on the top 5 results on the SERP (i.e daddy Google); we’re also competing against ourselves posting quick answers to hard technical questions in places such as [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [Quora](http://quora.com).

And to make it even worst, every technical person and their mother has started a blog at one point or the other.

That is because it’s not only a great way of trying to make a name for yourself in your particular field, but it’s also a great way to improve your communication skills, or even to deepen your knowledge in your field (after all, if you’re really trying to explain a subject, you need to properly understand it).

So having a technical blog is actually a great idea, what’s the problem with that? They’re often left behind and abandoned because writing a technical blog is actually hard and if you don’t do it right, you won’t get the exposure you’re looking for. And if there is no exposure, there are no views. One of the biggest lies ever told in the blogging community is this:
> # If you build it, they will come…

I don’t know who said it, **but it’s a lie. **They won’t come, nobody will read your content if you don’t share it properly. Just because the search engines have indexed it, doesn’t mean they’ll return it as a result, even if the search terms are perfect for your story.

And I know what you’re thinking... If I publish on Medium, they will share my content with readers for me. **Yet another lie.**

Medium will not do the work for you. You need traffic at first, finding a source of it will help you gain followers and then, yes, Medium will start sharing your content with them, but until that happens you need a boost.

And lucky for you, on Medium, in particular, there is a very easy way of getting it.

## The Power of Publications

Other articles will share 5 or 10 tips on how to achieve massive traffic, I’m going to only give you one,** so pay attention.**
> # Find-a-publication

Let me say that again… FIND-A-PUBLICATION.

When you’re first starting out anywhere, but especially on Medium, you’ll have no network of contacts, so whenever you publish something, most likely you won’t get any visibility.

Yes, there is a chance that you can get curated if your content is good enough and then Medium will try to distribute your article to potential readers. But you can’t really be certain if an article will get curated, you can follow all their guidelines, but it’s really up to the curators. And if your article doesn’t get curated, you don’t really get any useful feedback as to why that is.

So my advice: *let’s bet on the winning horse.*

Mind you, getting accepted is not easy but once you do, your article will get a considerable amount of views, and here is why:

Publications, especially big ones that have a huge amount of followers, will share your content with all of them. And then, if your content is liked by those readers, they will share them on different social networks, and then you get 100k views a month. Easy right?

In all seriousness, it’s not simple, it’s not easy, but if you manage to find a big publication that will share your articles with their followers, your views will start going up like crazy, and normally your followers will follow.

As an added bonus, publications will normally have an editorial process in place, just to make sure you’re not submitting garbage and they’re publishing it. Some might be more exhaustive than others, but in the end, you’re essentially **getting a free editor **as part of the combo. This is a major benefit because if you’re trying to publish on your own, you’re forced to read and re-read your article several times until you either go crazy or decide you’ve found all the problems in your piece (which might not actually be the case).

## Where Do I Find A Publication?

Now that you know about publications, I’m sure you’re asking yourself:
> # *How do I find them and get them to publish my work?!*

Well, my friend, first things first: those are two questions, not one! Now that we got that out of the way, the first question is easy, just to go medium.com/topics and click on the one you’re trying to publish for. Yes, your writing might fit in several of them, but pick the main one. Take [me](https://medium.com/@deleteman123) for example, I write a lot of JavaScript-related articles, they can be published under [Programming](https://medium.com/topic/programming) or [Software Engineering](https://medium.com/topic/software-engineering), but since I tend to focus on JavaScript, I’ll click on that topic and I’ll try to find articles published under publications. Here is what they look like:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3216/1*UWNxu5aLdn2qwtWM30KK8A.png)

Click on the publication’s name, and then to that URL, add “/latest” (like [https://medium.com/better-programming/**latest](https://medium.com/better-programming/latest)**). This will, of course, show you the latest articles published under that publication, but it will also show you this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*uxRkLCPdjzD2XX0JaSWIFA.png)

That’s right, the number of users that follow that publication. In other words, the reach your article will have once they agree to publish it.

So follow the above steps, find the publications with the most followers, research them, and read their submission guidelines (the key point here is if you ignore this step, they will ignore your submissions).

## Now Just Submit Your Work

In case you’re not fully aware of how to do this, once a publication has accepted you, they’ll add you as a writer, which will enable you to submit your drafts for their review.

You can do that by clicking on the three dots next to the “Publish” button of your edit screen, and then clicking on “Add to Publication”:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jgq4ZwJpMg4lZUrXWMEy4Q.png)

And then, just pick the one you’re submitting to, once you do, the “Publish” button will change to “Submit”. This will send your work to them and it will let them make modifications or even leave comments for you to fix different sections.

Once they’re happy with the way it looks, they’ll accept it and it’ll get published. You don’t have to worry about this part, it’s entirely on their side.

## Conclusion

That’s it, that’s the mega-secret I use to get between 80k to 100k views a month on my articles. I normally write between 3 and 5 articles a month, which if you think about it, it’s not that much but the main publication I write for ([Bits and Pieces](https://blog.bitsrc.io/)) has over 28k followers, so my articles get a fair amount of exposure. Coupled with the fact that most of them get curated under one of the topics I choose for them, Medium also helps distribute them.

So to sum things up, what do you have to do to increase your exposure?
> # Find-A-Publication

Other than that, of course, make sure [you structure your article correctly](https://medium.com/inside-blogging/the-structure-of-a-good-technical-article-bf8b92d959b7) and research your topic to deliver quality content, otherwise, the publication will either reject it or your article will not have the response you’d expect from it.
