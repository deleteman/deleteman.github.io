If you’ve been playing around and trying the waters with WordPress, you’ve probably had to deal with creating forms. You either had to add a contact form somewhere. sign-up forms, or even a log-in on at least one of the sites you’ve managed.
And at the same time, if you’ve been around for a while, you know you’re probably better off if you’re using a plugin for this. And I know, there are way too many form plugins out there to just pick one, but you can usually group them into: free and feature-limited, or paid and wonderful (unless of course, you don’t have the money to pay for them).

One particular, incredibly nice looking plugin that comes to mind when thinking about building forms is Typeform, of course, you can customize *everything* font face, colors, sizes, background, add images, and so on. And although they do have a FREE plan, if you actually want to gain all the benefits this plugin promises, you need to pay. And they’re not cheap, their basic plan is USD 35 a month, or USD 30 a month if you sign-up for a yearly plan (which of course means a single payment of USD 350  a year).

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying they’re not worth it, and if you have the money, then it’s probably not a big investment, but consider being a newcomer to blogging.  
You’re just starting out and trying to look professional, but unwilling to put down a lot of money up front (which is completely understandable) for that. If that’s you, 35 dollars a month, for a project that is giving you nothing back might be too much, so I’m here to tell you about a cheaper, and equally powerful plugin: [WPForms](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=2099099&m=64312&b=834775).


## Pay less and get great forms

</div>


If you’re looking for the best plugin for your site, something that is feature reach and allows you to create basic forms to capture data from your users, WPForms’ basic plan is perfect for you. It’s their cheapest option, and with only USD 79 ***a year*** , you’re getting:


- Unlimited number of forms
- Templates
- Multi-page forms (for those times you want to get complex with your users)
- Conditional logic, so you can decide what to show based on previous answers.
- SPAM Detection
- File uploads (already a winner!)
- Advanced fields
- Form layouts, to help you put things in a very aesthetic way.
- Form confirmation
- Form Notifications
- Custom CSS (hello there customization!)
- Custom captchas, to keep those f’ing robots away from your forms
- And some other minor details.

That's what you get from their basic pack, paying around USD 7 a month, that’s all. Yes, it’s true, if you compare one-to-one Typeform’s basic plan and WPForms, the first one has more features, of course, at a considerably higher cost.

The other hand of this comparison is also something you want to consider: if you’re in fact, willing to spend some money, the Elite level for WPForm sits at USD 600 a year, while for Typeform, their “Pro+” tier is 100 dollars more expensive (seating at USD 700). 


## What about their UX?

Working with these plugins, once you get over the paywall, you need something that gives you exactly what you want for the money that you're paying. 

### Adding forms to your site
Both plugins great and somewhat similar when it comes to creating forms. I do like however, the flexibility WPForms provides with the ability to either have traditional forms or turn them into [conversational forms](https://wpforms.com/addons/conversational-forms-addon/) whenever you feel like it versus Typeform’s only focus on conversational focus.

*This is what a conversational form looks like by the way.*

That being said, once you created the form, adding them to your site should be simple and in the case of WPForm is, just with a click. But for Typeform, you’re having to copy some HTML code on your templates. Advanced users will laugh at this, but there are *a lot of users* who don’t know about HTML **and don't want to know about it** and having to meddle with the code of their site will be scary and potentially, a problem for them.

So our winner here is: **WPForms**

### Flexibility of your form editor
Like I said before, creating the form should be simple, non-technical users will not know what an `input` tag is and how to configure the `form` element in order to upload the files. Besides, they’re paying for your plugin, so making their UX your #1 priority should be, in fact, your #1 priority.

And here is again, where WPForms shines. They both are great and have amazing pre-built templates for you to start working with, but at the same time, the focus Typeforms has on conversational forms is not great for me.
Polls, questionnaires, those work great for that kind of mechanics, but a contact form? And sign-up? People are used to a more traditional behavior, and trying to force-feed a conversation into that interaction simply does not work.

So our winner here is: **WPForms**

### Support
This is the final point I want to touch on. When paying for a plugin, no matter how big or small that plugin is, you want to get your money’s worth on support. If something’s not working or if you can’t figure out how to use their product, *you need support*.
And here both companies provide a similar service:

- Weekday support only (if things go wrong during the weekend, you better find another way around it).
- Different levels of support, depending on your paying tier.

But the winning factor here for me is their blog. As I said, their support teams only work during weekdays (Mon to Fri) and during business hours, so when your site fails outside that window, you need to go somewhere else and that is where official blogs come in.

WPForms’ blog is filled with how-to guides, examples of what to do and tutorials on using their plugin. This is what a truly helpful blog looks like:

While, on the other hand, Typeform’s blog is filled with guides, but not technical how-to guides, instead they’re more business-oriented. They’re a great help, don’t get me wrong, but not at all helpful for that time when everything is going wrong and you need help.

So, the final winner here is, again: **WPForms**


## Conclusion

You’ve probably guessed it by now, but if you’ve found Typeforms prices to be too high for your pocket, or if you’re looking to save some money while starting out a new business, [WPForms](https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=2099099&m=64312&b=834775) is the perfect match for you. 
Test it out, try their FREE tier and then upgrade once you’re ready, because trust me, *you will*.

_See you on the next one!_
