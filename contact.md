## Would you like to write a guest post for the blog?
Perfect! I'd love to publish it! Just send me an email with your idea, and we'll work through it. If your idea is in-line with the theme of _My Writing Corner_, then we'll go ahead and publish it.
Things to keep in mind:

- Try to make sure your submitting your own work.
- I'm not paying for blog posts right now, so make sure you're OK with that.
