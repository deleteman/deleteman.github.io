# Get in touch!
Are you looking to get in touch with me? You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/deleteman123) or, if you feel like a more personal conversation is needed, write me an [email](mailto:fernando.doglio@gmail.com).

## Would you like to write a guest post for the blog?
Perfect! I'd love to publish it! Just send me an email with your idea, and we'll work through it. If your idea is inline with the theme of _My Writing Corner_, then we'll go ahead and publish it.
Things to keep in mind:

- Try to make sure your submitting your own work.
- I don't care if you've published it somewhere else, we can add the canonical URL to the meta tags.
- I'm not paying for blog posts right now.
- Length is not an issue, just make sure it's not shorter than 400 words.

That is it, again, feel free to contact me if you want to work something out!
