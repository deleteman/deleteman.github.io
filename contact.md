Things to keep in mind:

- I'm not paying for blog posts right now, so make sure you're OK with that.
- Length is not an issue, just make sure it's not shorter than 700 words.
- I'll be taking a look a the blog post and I reserve any rights to edit the piece for SEO reasons
- You can have any number of links to your articles (as long as they make sense) and they'll be follow links
